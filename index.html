      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The <strong>Blackwall Tunnel</strong> is a key Thames river crossing linking <strong>Tower Hamlets</strong> and <strong>Greenwich</strong>.

        <br>
        It’s a lifeline for East London commuters but often suffers from congestion. Historically, it has been <strong>free to use</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        The <strong>Silvertown Tunnel</strong>, opening in <strong>April 2025</strong>, is a new dual-bore road tunnel connecting <strong>Silvertown</strong> to <strong>North Greenwich</strong>. Built to relieve traffic on Blackwall, it will introduce charges from day one.

    <!-- Final Advice -->
    
   <div>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">How Will the Blackwall Tunnel Charge Affect You?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        For local residents, the Blackwall Tunnel toll feels like a sudden cost added to a daily necessity.
        <br>
    If you live in boroughs like Newham, Greenwich, Tower Hamlets, or Lewisham, and commute across the tunnel by car, you’ll soon need to pay to use the Blackwall Tunnel. This could add up to hundreds of pounds a year in new travel costs.
   <br>
   <br>
    Let’s say the toll is £2.50 each way (though the final cost hasn’t been confirmed). That’s £5 a day  or £100 a month if you cross daily for work.
    For key workers, delivery drivers, tradespeople, and small businesses that rely on crossing the river multiple times a day, the cost becomes even more significant.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Will Drivers Avoid the Tunnels?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        With both crossings tolled, some drivers might look for other options. But the alternatives are limited.
        <br>
        <br>
        Rotherhithe Tunnel is already under pressure, and Tower Bridge experiences frequent congestion. The Dartford Crossing is far out for many East Londoners and also charges during peak hours.
        <br>
        <br>
        This has raised fears that tolls won’t reduce overall traffic but will shift congestion to other routes, making things worse elsewhere.
   </p>
  </div>

  <div>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        As of <strong>7 April 2025</strong>, anyone using the Silvertown or Blackwall Tunnel during chargeable hours must be registered and pay the toll, or risk receiving a <strong>Penalty Charge Notice (PCN)</strong>. Whether you're a regular commuter or occasional driver, be sure to set up TfL Auto Pay or check if you're eligible for discounts. Stay prepared and avoid surprises on the road.
